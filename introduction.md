"Since the initial outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, the virus has rapidly spread throughout the world (Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), n.d.). As of October 19th, 2020 there are 8,128,524 cases in the United States and 40 million worldwide (CDC, 2020b; WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID19) Dashboard, n.d.). Clinical evidence suggests that the primary mode of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is through exposure to infectious respiratory droplets. Infection through respiratory viruses can happen through direct transmission (like a handshake), droplet transmission, and airborne transmission (CDC, 2020a). In COVID-19 patients the main symptoms are fever and cough, characterized by lymphocytopenia- a lack of lymphocytes in blood- in the lungs of chest CT scans (Meng et al.,2020). Patients can also develop neurological indicators of infection such as headaches, dizziness, and impaired consciousness. In the most severe cases, acute cerebrovascular diseases, heart failure, kidney injury, and metabolic dysfunction was reported but this was often in those with underlying diseases or old age (Meng et al., 2020; Nepal et al., 2020). Some individuals also exhibit upper respiratory symptoms such as, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and olfaction changes. "
